So it was almost nothing new to me. Branching, merging are not a rocket science. 
But anyway it was usefull for me as I have investigated one thing I didn't know before, it was ```--no-ff``` key for ```merge``` command.
As for me this key provides more clear commit history, as in the case of fast-forward and no ```--no-ff``` key there will
be linear history when it must be like a graph. 
For ```log``` command I prefer to use ```--graph``` and ```--oneline``` keys :)
